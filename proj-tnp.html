			<div class="proj-subtitle">A SIC & TNP Collaboration</div>
			<p class="intro row">The Noun Project is an online platform resource for icons, symbols, and imagery. As an open source site, The Noun Project tout themselves as the place for ‘Creating, Sharing, and Celebrating the World’s Visual Language’. <br>
			</p>
				<p class="row">
				<span class="col-left">
					The Noun Project had recently launched a tiered pricing model for frequent icon users. They wanted to get a better understanding on who their users were, what the users activities were on the site, and what made their users purchase an icon versus downloading one for free. 
				</span>
				<span class="col-right">
					I had two roles in this project, the first as the project manager the second as a UX/UI designer. As project manager, I made sure that the group was aligned with the project timeline and accomplishing their tasks. I also was the point of contact with the Head of Product keeping a clear line of communication on our progress. Being the UX/UI designer, I conducted the interviews with the users, analyzed the information, and presented a strategy to the company at the end of the project.
				</span>
				</p>
				<p class="row">
					Since there was a limited length of time and resources, we focused on Noun Project users in Chicago. We contacted 94 of the 328 users and requested they fill out a preliminary survey about The Noun Project. After the responses, we contacted and conducted in-person user interviews with a variety of people whom were highly active on the site, from different professional backgrounds and a range of work experience. The interviews were video recorded for reference and the span of the interview was around 60 minutes. Also, they were almost always conducted at the interviewee’s home or workplace. We created loose guidelines for how we would conduct the interviews based on the information we wanted to know more about. We wanted the interviews to be more of a conversation rather than sterile interview. The insights from the interviews were organized into three main user personas of Noun Project users.
