			<h2 class="proj-title">The User Experience of The Noun Project</h2>
			<div class="proj-subtitle">SIC & TNP collaboration</div>
				<p class="row">
				Introduction<br>
					During my time in Startup Institute, I had the opportunity to work with The Noun Project. They had recently launched a new tiered pricing model and wanted to get some feedback about their users, the platform, and the efficacy of the new pricing. 
					The objective of the project was to get an understanding of TNP users and habits, and any apparent pain points when using The Noun Project site.<br>
					Since we had a limited amount of time and resources, we interviewed only existing TNP users in Chicago. 
				</p>
				<p class="row">
				<p class="col-left">
				About The Noun Project<br>
					The Noun Project was built on the idea of having an resource of symbols and icons. What makes the site unique is the opportunity for designers to upload their designs for use under the Creative Commons license. Thus, a designer can gain income or at the least be credited for their work. The Noun Project has contributors from all over the world and has now become a community that creates, shares and celebrates the world's visual language.
				</p>
				<p class="col-right">
				My Role<br>
					I was the Project Manager and UX designer. My responsibilities as the Project Manager were to be point of contact with The Noun Project Product team, keep the SIC team aligned with the project objectives and managing the timeline. As UX designer, I and another SIC UX designer developed and executed a user interview plan. My team and I then collaborated on presenting our findings to the TNP Product team.
				</p>
		    	<p class="row">
					Observations<br>
					The initial action was to send out a brief survey to Chicago users on their activity on the platform. From the responses, we chose a handful of users with diverse backgrounds and usage habits to have an in-person interview.<br>
					We created an outline separating interview questions into sections asking about their background, inquiries about icons and icon usage, their knowledge of TNP, their experiences using the platform.<br>
					The guidelines of the interview were to approach the interviews less as "question and answer" and more of a conversation. Our approach allowed the interviewee to be more comfortable, and lead to more candid answers.<br>

				<p class="row">
					Discovery<br>
					After we completed the interviews, we collected our information and created three user personas from our findings.</p>
				<p class="row">
					Design<br>
					Our observations from usability testing with users made us think of some solutions to a couple pain points on The Noun Project's new feature, Kits.</p>

				</div>
				<p class="col-left">
					Kits was a new feature that allows users to collect and organize icons that users might find inspiration in, use frequently, or may want to use in the future. Another aspect of Kits that is unique is the allowance of sharing a kit within an organization or other users.<br>
				</p>
				<p class="col-right">
				Pain points with kits<br>
					Users did not know what Kits were or its purpose.suggestion: introduction to kits as an onboarding process(standard layout that could be used for future added features)<br>
					Had users struggle to figure out how to add an icon to a Kit.
					suggestion: highlight the suitcase icon in the onboarding process

					Things to consider<br>
					Marketing plan: using things like Pinterest, and blog to show users different ways they can use icons outside of typical uses.
					Business plan: modifying pricing model, unlimited dl of icons monthly subscription per user. Large agencies and organizations have an option for  yearly plan since they have a complex way of </p>
